        <h4>I am a Junior at Boise State Univeristy studying Integrated Media and Strategic Communications.<br> I grew up in Southern California but have loved living in Idaho by exploring new terrains and opportunities.<br>Besides my passion for videos, photos, and film - I love dogs especially Moose (in the picture). <br>Some of my hobbies include snowboarding, surfing, playing games with friends, and getting outside in the sun.</h4>
        
        <h4>I currently work for Magnetic Creative, a Branding and Marketing Company based out of California.<br>Over the past 5 years I have been able to work on many photo/video shoots, edit projects for social use,<br>and work with a bunch of awesome clients. By shadowing some very creative videographers,<br> editors, directors, and producers, I have been able to learn valuable knowledge in the field of Media. </h4>
