        <p>Some believe the taco was invented between 1000 and 500 B.C, although the word 'taco' originated from Mexican silver miners in the 18th century. At the time it was used to describe the thin sheets of paper wrapped in gunpowder that was used as an explosive, although the miners did enjoy a more flavorsome alternative as part of their staple diet.</p>

    <p>Tacos are delicious and if you haven't had a good one, you're missing out.<mark> The most important part is good corn torilla or flour if you prefer</mark> Without a tortilla there would be no taco basically. In addition, the way you make the tortilla is important too. Each person likes it a different way and in this case it would be soft so it is important to make sure you cook it precisely. </p>

<small>Some desserts that go well with tacos are - </small>
<dl>
    <dt>Tarta de Santiago</dt>
    <dd>Made with almonds, orange zest, and almond zest, Tarta de Santiago is similar to Spanish almond cake.</dd>
    <dt>Leche Frita (fired milk)</dt>
    <dd>Easy. You turn milk into a custardy pudding, coat it with breading, and fry! And the result? Oh my. I can munch on fried milk every day.</dd>

     <p>I love almost all kinds od Mexican Foods.<strong> However, Tacos are probably my favorite.</strong> I would say burritos are a close second and taquitos are a close third.</p>
